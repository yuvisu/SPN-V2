# Snippet Policy Network

This repository is the official implementation of [Snippet Policy Network V2: Knee-Guided Neuroevolution for Multi-Lead ECG Early Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9825701), published at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.

### Guideline:



We provide a well-trained model (the model of the first fold in 10-fold cross-validation) to validate the performance in our paper.
